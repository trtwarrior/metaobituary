Background: 

We are a group of strong believers in Web3 & NFT, which can promote openness and permanent existence to remember. The current obituary service on major newspapers could be quite expensive, thus not everyone can afford such service. The alternative is to put obituary online, however it is vulnerable and has to keep paying storage costs and website maintenance fees. Overall, we believe NFT could provide the best solution for it.  



Features: 

FREE - it's a 100% free service, users don't pay extra fee to us except the gas fee for minting NFT. It's a public service and we accept donations.



OPEN - it opens to everyone and we will make our code public after release. 



DIGNITY - it brings dignity comparing to social media post which can be noisy in the background and got lost a few years later if such social media platform decides to shut down.



OWNERSHIP - the user has the obituary NFT in their wallet and they has the ultimate ownership of the obituary.



FOREVER - it provides a place for people who wanted a place to commemorate forever. 



SIMPLICITY - we built on Ethereum and support the ERC721 format. It can shown in all major NFT browsers and can be shared by sending to other people's wallets. It's easy to use and easy to share.



CUSTOMIZE - We support Image + Video + Text in the obituary NFT to provide fully customizable product for users. It can be displayed digitally in the physical service or in Metaverse at the discretion of creator. In condition of error, the creator can send NFT to zero address to burn it and recreate a right one.
