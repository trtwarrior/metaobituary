Metaobituary.com

**Background:**
We are a group of strong believers in the NFT, which can promote openess and forever existence. It perfectly fits the Obituary.

**Features:**
FREE - it's a 100% free service, we don't charge any fee except the user pays the gas fee. We are looking for donation/fundings, if possible, we can waive gas fee for users.
OEPN - it opens to everyone and we will make our code public.
OWNERSHIP - the user has the NFT in their wallet and they has the ultimate ownership of the obituary.
FOREVER - we believe the obituary should be able to kept forever, that's why NFT is the best vehicle comparing to web2 online information which might be lost after a few years. 
ETHEREUM - we built on Ethereum and support the ERC721 format.

**Progress:**
Currently, it's under development. As of Feb 17th, Front end development ----- 10%; Smart Contact development ---- 40%.
